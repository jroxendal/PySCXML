<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!-- two transitions conflict if the 
    intersection of the set of states they exit is non-null. Among transitions 
    that confict, the earlier one in document order preempts the later one. When 
    P is entered, eventp is raised and the transitions in p1 and p3 should be 
    taken, while those in p2 is preempted. The transition in p1 raises event1, 
    which triggers the transition in P2. It in turn preempts the transition in 
    P3. The transitions through s1 - s3 test that each transition was taken once. 
    (using multiple states each with a single test makes the xslt simpler. -->
